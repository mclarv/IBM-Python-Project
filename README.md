This notebook serves as a tutorial of the API interaction between Python a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) API. This particularly useful as the information can be delivered from a source in multiple ways that is both readable by machines and humans. This allows us to complete things such as webscaping to analyze the data in one format, parse it to another, and transform it into an analysis. The tutorial below shows this using the pandas, numpy, and GeckoCoinAPI packages. It studies Bitcoin prices and is great for data modeling as the information is updated every hour and the software is relatively easy to use.
